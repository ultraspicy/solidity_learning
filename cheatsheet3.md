Ownable contract
 - Constructors: constructor() is a constructor, which is an optional special function. It will get executed only one time, when the contract is first created.
 - A function modifier looks just like a function, but uses the keyword modifier instead of the keyword function. And it can't be called directly like a function can â€” instead we can attach the modifier's name at the end of a function definition to change that function's behavior.
 - Normally there's no benefit to using these sub-types because Solidity reserves 256 bits of storage regardless of the uint size. For example, using uint8 instead of uint (uint256) won't save you any gas. But there's an exception to this: inside structs. If you have multiple uints inside a struct, using a smaller-sized uint when possible will allow Solidity to pack these variables together to take up less storage. 
 - You'll also want to cluster identical data types together (i.e. put them next to each other in the struct) so that Solidity can minimize the required storage space. For example, a struct with fields uint c; uint32 a; uint32 b; will cost less gas than a struct with fields uint32 a; uint c; uint32 b; because the uint32 fields are clustered together.

 Time unit
 - The variable now will return the current unix timestamp of the latest block (the number of seconds that have passed since January 1st 1970).
 - Solidity also contains the time units `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `days`, `weeks` and `years`. These will convert to a uint of the number of seconds in that length of time. So 1 minutes is 60, 1 hours is 3600 (60 seconds x 60 minutes), 1 days is 86400

 View functions don't cost gas
  - you can optimize your DApp's gas usage for your users by using read-only external view functions wherever possible.
  - view function is called internally from another function in the same contract that is not a view function, it will still cost gas. This is because the other function creates a transaction on Ethereum, and will still need to be verified from every node. So view functions are only free when they're called externally.
